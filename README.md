# Algorithm Benchmark Suite

This project benchmarks custom C++ algorithms with high-resolution timing, aiming to evaluate performance for various data sizes and algorithm types.

## Features

- Modular design with abstract base class (`AlgorithmBenchmark`)
- High-resolution timing using `std::chrono`
- CLI-configurable data size
- Clean output of runtime results
- Easily extendable with additional algorithm implementations
